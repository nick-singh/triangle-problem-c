Problem : Triangle Problem...
	
	Given a triangular matrix, with the number of rows calculate 
	the best sum that can be obtained from the values in the 
	triangle.


	Methods Implemented:
	Brute Force
	Recursion
	Memorized Recursion
	Dynamic Programming



Inputs with different number of rows can be found in "all input.txt"
Copy and past desired triangle(no. of rows 5-100) into "input.txt"

Note: For rows > 15 it is not recommended to use int bruteForceTriangle and int recursiveTriangle because of the runtime.
